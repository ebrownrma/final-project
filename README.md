# Working title: 

Treeshrew Speciation

# Project summary (1-2 sentences): 

Can neutral theory explain the current species diversity of Scandentia (treeshrews), an order that's been around for upwards of 50 million years and occupies much of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, yet only boasts around 20 species?

# What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?:

There are a number of treeshrew species with multiple subspecies that are typically distinguished by unique color morphs or geographic separation. Neutral theory may give the impression that a number of these subspecies are supported as distinct species, which could help direct how these species are delineated. Very little genetic work has been conducted in the identification and/or delineation of species, so having an idea of how many species we might expect could also rein in loose qualifiers of what constitutes a species. 

The Sundaland basin has grown and shrunk with the glaciations of the past several million years, and so additional available habitat for treeshrews has come and gone, as well as connectivity within the Malay archipeligo and between it and the Asian mainland. Are there extinctions in Scandentia that could be associated with the loss of terrestrial habitat?

How do you plan to tackle this project?:

We plan to run simulations like were demonstrated in class that allow for speciation and extinction over deep time. We can divide a number of different scenarios between us (different rates of migration, extinction, etc.) that might explain the evolutionary trajectory of Scandentia.

What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?:

What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?:

How can Andy or Renata help?:
