## Eric Notes
Treeshrews (Order Scandentia) have evolved wholly within Southeast and South Asia over the past 50 - 60 million years. In this time, the Indian subcontinent collided with mainland Asia and the Sundaland landmass that consists today of much of the Malay archipeligo west of Sulawesi continuously morphed in size and connectivity with the Southeast Asian mainland. Especially in the last several million years, glaciation events have routinely connected and isolated various islands from the mainland in Southeast Asia. Treeshrews diversified in this 50-odd million years, and the 20 described species currently range from India in the west to the Philippines in the east, and southern China south through western islands in the Malay archipelago. Many of these species consist of multiple subspecies that are commonly differentiated by color morph and/or geographic connectivity. Very little genotyping of these species or subspecies has been accomplished, and little is known about the life histories of most of them. Consequently the Scandentia phylogeny is still contested, though most of the order seems to have been established by at least 5 million years ago [Roberts et al. - 2011 - Molecular phylogeny of treeshrews (Mammalia Scand.pdf](https://github.com/ebrownrma/final-project/files/10186891/Roberts.et.al.-.2011.-.Molecular.phylogeny.of.treeshrews.Mammalia.Scand.pdf). As many islands in the Malay archipelago have become isolated since the Pleistocene glaciations, the dozens of subspecies may be legitimate species. Equally unknown is the number of populations, subspecies, and/or species that have gone extinct from Scandentia.  

Traditional island biogeography describes equilibrium in species diversity on an island as a function of immigration and extinction balancing with one another over time. Others have argued that this omits other diversification mechanisms such as _in situ_ speciation, particularly on considerably isolated islands where immigration rate is much slower than less isolated islands. [Ecology Letters - 2015 - Valente - Equilibrium and non‚Äêequilibrium dynamics simultaneously operate in the Gal pagos islands.pdf](https://github.com/ebrownrma/final-project/files/10187230/Ecology.Letters.-.2015.-.Valente.-.Equilibrium.and.non.equilibrium.dynamics.simultaneously.operate.in.the.Gal.pagos.islands.pdf). Important to consider here are taxa-specific rates of immigration, as some taxa (e.g. birds) are less limited by geographic connnectivity than others (e.g. small mammals). Can islands within larger island systems such as the Malay archipelago be considered isolated for taxa such as treeshrews? If so, do recently proposed phylogenies support this notion? A model such as
